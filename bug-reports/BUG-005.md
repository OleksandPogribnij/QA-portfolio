## Description

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to https://dou.ua/
2. Scroll down and view the UI layout of the footer

### Actual Result
Social media icons (Facebook, X, GitHub, etc.) are visually superimposed on the text “We are on social media” in the footer of the page. The text becomes unreadable, which violates the integrity of the interface.

### Expected Result
All footer elements should be displayed according to the layout, without overlapping each other. There should be sufficient spacing between the text description and the icon block to ensure clear readability of the text.
