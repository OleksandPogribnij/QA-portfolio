## Description
When attempting to submit data with a past check-in date, the application returns a critical client-side exception. Instead of validating the date, the page interface disappears completely, displaying a system error message about the upload.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to the website https://automationintesting.online/;
2. In the “Check Availability & Book Your Stay” section, select the check-in date 01/01/2026 - 02/02/2026;
3. In the “Our rooms” section, select (for example) a Double room;
4. On the page that opens (https://automationintesting.online/reservation/2?checkin=2026-01-01&checkout=2026-01-02), click the “Reserve now” button;
5. Enter the following information in the fields (see Test Data);
6. Click on the “Reserve now” button;

### Test Data
- First name - Daniel
- Last name - Moroz
- Email - daniel.moroz48291@gmail.com
- Telephone - +380000000000

### Actual Result
After attempting to access the reservation page with parameters for a past date in the URL (https://automationintesting.online/reservation/2?checkin=2026-01-01&checkout=2026-01-02), the application interface completely disappears (“crashes”) and a white screen appears with a system error message.

The error text on the screen:
*Application error: a client-side exception has occurred while loading automationintesting.online (see the browser console for more information).*

Additional observations:
- The error occurs at the page rendering level (client-side).
- Further interaction with the page is impossible without completely reloading it.
- The developer console (DevTools Console) records an error of the TypeError or ReferenceError type (it is recommended to add a screenshot of the console).

### Expected Result
The system must correctly process invalid or past dates in URL parameters without disrupting the application interface.
