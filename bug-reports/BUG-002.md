3. Check the availability of the product in the field “Availability”;
4. Try adding the product to your cart;

### Actual Result
p.3. The product has the status “Out of stock”.

p.4. The “Add to cart” button is active. When clicked, a pop-up appears confirming that the product has been successfully added to the cart. The item is added to the cart. In response to the request, we see the 200 OK status code.
